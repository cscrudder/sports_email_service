# Sports Email Service
We are using the SportsRadar API.

Need to set up a .env file. Jack, I'll email you the key.

You need a different API key for each sport. If you go to our account info page, you can find ones for NHL, NFL, NBA, and MLB.

Here's the developer page link: https://developer.sportradar.com/docs/read/Home#getting-started

The 'API Sandbox' is particularly helpful. You just tell the website what data you want and it generates the URL you need.
